  <h2>Lyrics to help you get through:</h2>
  <p class="lyrics">Spend all your time waiting,<br>
  For that second chance<br>
  For a break that would make it okay<br>
  There's always some reason<br>
  To feel not good enough<br>
  And it's hard at the end of the day<br>
  I need some distraction<br>
  Oh a beautiful release<br>
  Memories seep from my veins<br>
  Let me be empty<br>
  Oh and weightless and maybe<br>
  I'll find some peace tonight<br>
  In the arms of the angel<br>
  Fly away from here<br>
  From this dark cold hotel room<br>
  And the endlessness that you fear<br>
  You are pulled from the wreckage<br>
  Of your silent reverie<br>
  You're in the arms of the angel<br>
  May you find some comfort here<br>
  So tired of the straight line<br>
  And everywhere you turn<br>
  There's vultures and thieves at your back<br>
  And the storm keeps on twisting<br>
  You keep on building the lies<br>
  That you make up for all that you lack<br>
  It don't make no difference<br>
  Escaping one last time<br>
  It's easier to believe<br>
  In this sweet madness<br>
  Oh this glorious sadness<br>
  That brings me to my knees<br>
  In the arms of the angel<br>
  Fly away from here<br>
  From this dark cold hotel room<br>
  And the endlessness that you fear<br>
  You are pulled from the wreckage<br>
  Of your silent reverie<br>
  You're in the arms of the angel<br>
  May you find some comfort here<br>
  You're in the arms of the angel<br>
  May you find some comfort here</p>
